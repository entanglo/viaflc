      {
        "q": "Which payout address can I use?",
        "a": "Use an FLC wallet address. That is the only payout option for now; more coins unlock as their payouts go live. Need one? Follow the [[link:twalletGuide]]."
      },
      {
        "q": "Which coins do I earn while merge mining?",
        "a": "You earn FLC today. More Scrypt coins will unlock as soon as we launch their templates."
      },
      {
        "q": "How does the payout schedule work?",
        "a": "We use PPLNS payouts. When a coin matures, you get paid for your valid Sharenotes."
      },
      {
        "q": "How do I track my miners and Sharenotes?",
        "a": "Use the Hashboard section above, paste your payout address, and watch live hash rate, rewards, and Sharenotes there."
      },
      {
        "q": "What is a Sharenote and why does it matter?",
        "a": "A Sharenote is a signed receipt for each accepted share. Learn more at [[link:shareNote]]."
      },
      {
        "q": "How does Sharenote power the Web of Fun (WoF) ecosystem?",
        "a": "WoF uses Sharenotes as tickets for social apps, games, and rewards built on provable work. See what your hashpower unlocks at [[link:wofDocs]]."

      {
        "q": "Where can I get help or share feedback?",
